### 3. Backend - Admin Middleware (`server/middleware/adminAuth.js`)

- ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden for non-admin users

### 4. Backend - Admin Routes (`server/routes/admin.js`)
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/users` - List all users
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/users/:userId` - Get user details with their tasks
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/tasks` - Get all tasks from all users
- ✅ `GET /api/admin/stats` - Get system-wide statistics

### 5. Backend - Server Integration (`server/index.js`)
- ✅ Added admin routes to Express application

### 6. Frontend - API Client (`client/src/utils/api.js`)
- ✅ Added admin API endpoints
- ✅ Integrated with existing authentication flow

### 7. Frontend - Admin Page (`client/src/pages/Admin.jsx`)
- ✅ Created comprehensive admin dashboard
- ✅ Three tabs: Overview, Users, All Tasks
- ✅ Statistics cards showing system metrics
- ✅ User list with click-to-view details
- ✅ Task visualization with priority and status badges
- ✅ Real-time data fetching

### 8. Frontend - Navigation (`client/src/components/Layout.jsx`)

- ✅ Reads user admin status from localStorage
- ✅ Conditional rendering based on admin privileges

### 9. Frontend - Routing (`client/src/App.jsx`)
- ✅ Added `/admin` route
- ✅ Protected by authentication

### 10. Documentation
- ✅ Created `ADMIN_GUIDE.md` with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Included security considerations
- ✅ Added troubleshooting guide

## How to Use

### For Users
1. **Regular Users:** Log in normally - no changes to their experience
2. **Admin Users:** Log in and see the "Admin" link in navigation

### Default Admin Account
```
Email: admin@taskmanager.com
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

### Testing the Admin Features
1. Start the server: `npm run server`
2. Start the client: `npm run client` (in another terminal)
3. Log in with admin credentials
4. Click "Admin" in the navigation
5. Explore the three tabs:
   - **Overview:** System statistics
   - **Users:** User management and task tracking
   - **All Tasks:** Complete task overview

## Security Features

✅ **Server-side validation:** All admin endpoints verify admin status in database  
✅ **JWT token security:** Admin status embedded in tokens  
✅ **Middleware protection:** Admin routes protected by custom middleware  
✅ **Frontend hiding:** Admin links hidden from non-admin users  
✅ **Error handling:** Proper 403 Forbidden responses for unauthorized access
